    <h1>New Credentials Aquisition</h1>

    <p>
      Acquiring new credentials can be done through the New
      Credentials Wizard, which can be invoked through one of the
      following methods:

      <ul>
        <li><p>Selecting <span class="pre">Credential -> Obtain new credentials</span> from the <a href="menu_credential.htm">Credentials</a> menu</p></li>

        <li><p>By typing <span class="pre">Ctrl + N</span>.</p></li>

        <li><p>Using the <span class="pre">New credentials</span>
            (<img src="images/tk-new.bmp" />) command from
            the <a href="tb_standard.htm">toolbar</a>.

        <li><p>Selecting <span class="pre">Obtain new credentials ...</span> from the context menu in the credentials display area</p></li>

        <li><p>Using the context menu in the Network Identity Manager
            icon in the system notification area.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The first time it is invoked, the new credentials wizard shows
      you the <a href="#idspec">identity specification page</a>.  The
      workflow in this case is illustrated below:

      <div class="imgbox">
        <img src="images/new-creds-wf-new.png" alt="Workflow for obtaining new credentials for an identity for the first time"/>
        <p class="caption">Workflow for obtaining new credentials for
        an identity for the first time.</p>
      </div>
    </p>

    <p>However, on subsequent invocations, the new credentials wizard
      will take you directly to the <a href="#basic">password</a>
      page, as illustrated below:

      <div class="imgbox">
        <img src="images/new-creds-wf-next.png" alt="Workflow for obtaining new credentials after an identity is configured"/>
        <p class="caption">Workflow for obtaining new credentials after an identity is configured.</p>
      </div>
    </p>

    <a name="idspec"/>
    <h3>Identity Specification Page</h3>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="images/new-creds-idspec.png" alt="New credentials wizard - Identity specification"/>
      <p class="caption">The identity specification page</p>
    </div>

    <p>If the Kerberos v5 identity provider is used, the dialog will
      ask for a username and a realm to determine the identity for
      which new credentials will be obtained.  Depending on the
      selected identity, you may be required to provide a password or
      other form of authentication before new credentials can be
      obtained.
    </p>

    <p>By default, the only identity selector available is Kerberos
      v5.  If you have other plug-ins installed that provide identity
      selectors, they will appear in the identity selection panel
      allowing you to choose other identity types.
    </p>

    <p>Once the desired identity has been specified, you can select
      the <span class="pre">Next</span> button to advance to the next
      page of the wizard.
    </p>

    <p>If you arrived at the identity specification page from another
      page in the new credentials wizard, selecting
      the <span class="pre">Back</span> button will take you back to
      that previous page.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <img src="images/note.png" alt="Note:"/>
      <p>If the selected identity requires validation, then the
        identity specification page will take you to the identity
        validation page next.  From here, you will be able to observe
        progress of the validation process and also observe any
        problems it might encounter.</p>

      <p>You will only be able to proceed with identity configuration
        or credentials acquisition if the identity passes
        validation.</p>
    </div>

    <a name="idsel" />
    <h3>Identity Selection</h3>

    <p>Most of the pages on the new credentials wizard have a large
      button on the top that shows the currently selected identity.
      Clicking the button will present you with the identity selection
      menu:</p>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="images/new-creds-idsel.png" alt="New credentials wizard - Identity selection"/>
      <p class="caption">Identity selection menu</p>
    </div>

    <p>The list of identities shown are the identities that you
      supports acquiring new credentials.  In addition,
      the <span class="pre">New identity</span> option allows you to
      specify an identity that is not listed or configured.  Selecting
      this option takes you to the <a href="#idspec">Identity
      Specification</a> page.</p>

    <p>Selecting any other identity will take you either to the
      password page for that identity or the identity configuration
      pages depending on whether this is the first time you are
      getting credentials for that identity.  If you had already
      selected an identity, then the corresponding menu item will
      appear disabled.</p>

    <a name="idcfg" />
    <h3>New Identity Configuration</h3>

    <p>When a new identity is specified, the New Credentials Wizard
      switches over to the New Identity Configuration Wizard and
      guides you through the available options for this identity.  You
      only need to do this once for an identity.
    </p>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="images/new-creds-wiz-k5.png" alt="New credentials wizard - Identity configuration" />
      <p class="caption">New credentials wizard during identity
        configuration</p>
    </div>

    <p>The <span class="pre">Next</span>
      and <span class="pre">Back</span> buttons will take you through
      the available options pages and finally the password page, where
      you will be asked for the password for the identity.
    </p>

    <p>If the identity does not require a password, then you can
      select <span class="pre">Finish</span> at any time to obtain
      credentials using the default settings.
    </p>

      <p class="caption">New credentials wizard showing the password
      page of identity configuration</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <img src="images/note.png" alt="Note:" />
      <p>The password that you enter here will not be stored by
        Network Identity Manager unless you also check
        the <span class="pre">Save password</span> check box.  Network
        Identity Manager ships with a default key storage provider
        called KeyStore which lets you store multiple passwords that
        are protected by a master password.
      </p>

        see <a href="act_new_creds_persistence.htm">'Password
          persistence'</a></p>

    </div>

    <a name="progress"/>
    <h3>Progress</h3>

    <p>As the final step of the New Credentials Wizard, you will be
      shown the progress page, where you can monitor the progress of
      the credential acquisition operation.</p>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="images/new-creds-progress.png" alt="New credentials wizard - Progress page"/>
      <p class="caption">New credentials wizard at the progress
      page</p>
    </div>

    <p>If there are any problems with acquring new credentials, they
      will be shown to you here as illustrated below:</p>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="images/new-creds-progress-error.png" alt="Progress page showing error"/>
      <p class="caption">Progress page showing an error while acquiring new credentials</p>
    </div>

    <p>If an error occurs, you may select
      the <span class="pre">Back</span> button to go back to the
      password page or the credentials options pages and take any
      necessary corrective action.  If you believe the error was due
      to a transient condition, you can select
      the <span class="pre">Retry</span> button to retry the operation
      using the current settings and the previously entered password
      (if any).</p>

    <a name="basic"/>
    <h3>New credentials wizard - For a known identity</h3>

    <p>Once one or more identities are configured, the new credentials
      wizard will take on a different appearance.
    </p>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="images/new-creds-k5-pw.png" alt="New credentials wizard - Kerberos v5 password"/>
      <p class="caption">New credentials wizard - Kerberos v5 password</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since Network Identity Manager already has the configuration
      information it needs to process the new credentials operation,
      all it needs from you is the password for the Kerberos v5
      principal.  Once you enter the password and
      select <span class="pre">Finish</span> you will be taken to the
      'Progress' panel.
    </p>

    <p>In addition, you may also make the selected identity the
      default identity using the <span class="pre">Make this the
      default identity</span> check box before clicking
      the <span class="pre">Finish</span> button.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <img src="images/note.png" alt="Note:" />
      <p>The password that you enter here will not be stored by
        Network Identity Manager unless you also check
        the <span class="pre">Save password</span> check box.  Network
        Identity Manager ships with a default key storage provider
        called KeyStore which lets you store multiple passwords that
        are protected by a master password.

        see <a href="keystore.htm">KeyStore</a>.
    </div>

    <a name="advanced"/>
    <h3>New credential wizard - Advanced options</h3>

    <p>Clicking on the <span class="pre">Advanced options</span>
      button from the <a href="#basic">password page</a> will bring
      you to this pane.</p>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="images/new-creds-adv.png" alt="New credentials wizard - Advanced panel"/>
      <p class="caption">New credentials wizard - Advanced page</p>
    </div>

    <p>This page presents you with all the options available for
      obtaining credentials for the selected identity.  Each pane in
      the tabbed area corresponds to a credentials provider that is
      participating in the credentials acquisition.  You may see
      additional tabs here if you have other plug-ins installed.</p>

    <p>More information about options specific to each credentials
      type can be found below:

      <ul>
        <li><a href="config_identity_k5.htm">Kerberos v5</a></li>
        <li><a href="config_identity_k4.htm">Kerberos v4</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <img src="images/note.png" alt="Note:"/>
      <p>Any changes you make in the credentials type configuration
      panels here may not be saved unless you proceed with the new
      credentials operation.  If you wish to make changes to the
      identity configuration without obtaining new credentials, you
      should use the <a href="use_config.htm">Configuration
      dialog</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Additional notes</h3>

    <p>The new credentials dialog can be invoked from the command line using
      the <span class="pre"> -i </span> or <span class="pre"> --kinit
      </span> command line option.  Additionally, if you specify the
      <span class="pre"> -a </span> or <span class="pre">
      --autoinit </span> command line option, the new credentials
      dialog will be displayed if there are no credentials available.
    </p>

    <p>
      Setting the <span class="pre">Obtain new credentials at startup
      (if none are present)</span> option in
      the <span class="pre">General</span> configuration panel causes
      NetIDMgr to behave as if the <span class="pre">--autoinit</span>
      option is specified at the beginning of each session.
    </p>
