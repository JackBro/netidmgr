    <h1>Password Persistence</h1>

    <p>Starting with Network Identity Manager 2.0, you have the option
      of securely storing your passwords using the included KeyStore
      plug-in.</p>

    <p>The utility of storing passwords is most apparent if you have
      more than one identity that you obtain initial credentials for
      at once.  When you acquire credentials for a key store, Network
      Identity Manager automatically initializes all the identities
      that are stored there.  Therefore, with a single password you
      can obtain credentials for multiple identities.</p>

    <h4>Saving your password</h4>

    <p>The password entry pages in the new credentials wizard will ask
      you whether you would like to save the entered password.  Simply
      check the option.  You will then be asked for the master
      password the KeyStore.  If you haven't set up a master password,
      it will ask you to enter the password twice, since you are
      setting up a new password.  Once the dialog completes, your
      password will be added to the key store.</p>

    <h4>Obtaining new credentials using the key store</h4>

    <p>Select an identity that is stored in the key store and invoke
      the <a href="act_new_creds.htm">New credentials wizard</a>.  You
      will automatically be prompted for the key store
      credentials.</p>

    <p>After you supply the key store master password, credentials for
      all the identities stored in the key store will be obtained.</p>

    <h4>Removing stored passwords from a key store</h4>

    <p>Start the <a href="use_config.htm">configuration dialog</a> and

      key store identity in the credentials display and
      select <span class="pre">show identity options</span>).</p>

    <p>In the identity configuration page for the key store, select

        removed.</p>
