    <h1>How To Choose a Password</h1>

    <p>Your passwords are the keys to many computers, from a bank
    machine to a multiuser mainframe to a server on a network. Your
    password helps to prove that you are who you say you are, and
    ensures your privacy.
    </p>


    <p>Compromised passwords are the means by which most unauthorized
    (and unscrupulous) people gain access to a system. Someone logging
    on under your name has access not only to your computer files, but
    to most of the facilities of the computer system. Since tampering
    can have far-reaching and serious consequences, it's important to
    take to heart the following guidelines for choosing a
    password.</p>

    <p>Do choose:

      <ul>
<li>Something easy for you to remember with at least six characters.</li>
<li>Something obscure. For instance, you might deliberately misspell a term or use an odd character in an otherwise familiar term, such as "phnybon" instead of "funnybone." Or use a combination of two unrelated words or a combination of letters and numbers.</li>
<li>A combination of letters and numbers, or a phrase like "many colors" and then use only the consonants "mnYc0l0rz."</li>
<li>An acronym for your favorite saying, for example, "L!isn!" (Live! It's Saturday Night!)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Don't choose:
<ul>
<li>Your name in any form - first, middle, last, maiden, spelled backwards, nickname or initials.</li>
<li>Your userid or your userid spelled backwards.</li>
<li>Part of your userid or name.</li>
<li>Any common name, such as Joe.</li>
<li>The name of a close relative, friend, or pet.</li>
<li>Your phone or office number, address, birthday, or anniversary.</li>
<li>Your license-plate number, your social-security number, or any all numeral password.</li>
<li>Names from popular culture, e.g., spock, sleepy. </li>
<li>Any word in a dictionary.</li>
<li>Passwords of fewer than four characters.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4> Mum's the Word</h4>
<p>
Never tell anyone your password -- not even your system administrator or account manager -- and don't write it down. Make sure you have chosen a password that you can remember. And, finally, change your password at regular intervals</p>
