    <h1>What's new in Network Identity Manager</h1>

    <h3>Network Identity Manager 2.0</h3>

    <p>This version of Network Identity Manager presents a significant
      improvement over the Network Identity Manager 1.x.

    <h4>Multiple identity provider support</h4>

    <p>Network Identity Manager 1.x only supports a single
      <a href="concept_ident_pro.htm">identity provider</a>.  This was
      sufficient when only Kerberos v5 identities are to be supported.
      However, not all network identities are based on Kerberos v5.
      In order to support other identity classes such as X.509
      certificates and key stores, support for multiple identity providers
      is required.</p>

    <p>Adding multiple identity providers required changes to the user
      interface, the configuration system and the credentials database.
      Selecting an identity type is now an integral part of the
      creation of a new identity via the "New Credentials Wizard".</p>

    <p>In addition to the Kerberos v5 identity provider, this version
      includes a KeyStore identity provider and developer resources
      for building additional identity providers.</p>

    <h4>New Credentials Wizard</h4>

    <p>The new credentials dialog from version 1 has been completely
      replaced by the new credentials wizard.  This new interface
      separates the processes of specifying identities, configuring
      identities and obtaining new credentials for identities.</p>

    <p>When attempting to specify a new identity, the new credentials
      wizard automatically switches to the new identity configuration
      wizard which guides the user through the available options and
      credentials providers.  This process only needs to be completed
      once for each identity and is optional.</p>

    <p>The new credentials wizard is
      documented <a href="act_new_creds.htm">here</a>

    <h4>Credentials Display</h4>

    <p>The credentials display was also
      replaced.  <a href="wnd_main.htm">The new interface</a> supports
      more widgets and provides live feedback of on-going credential
      operations.
    </p>

    <h4>KeyStore</h4>

    <p>The KeyStore is a password storage plug-in for Network Identity
      Manager that was designed to address the needs of users who need
      to obtain credentials for multiple identities simultaneously.
    </p>

    <p>More information about the KeyStore plug-in can be
      found <a href="keystore.htm">here</a>.</p>

    <h4>Developer Resources</h4>

    <p>The software development kit for developing plug-ins for
      Network Identity Manager was updated to include a template for
      an identity provider plug-in.  The credentials provider
      plug-in was updated to be compatible with the new API.</p>

    <p>Even though the API for Network Identity Manager has changed
      significantly from version 1.x to version 2, the ABI remains
      backward compatible for compliant credentials providers.
      Backwards compatibility was tested using OpenAFS and KCA
      plug-ins that were written to work with version 1.x API.</p>
