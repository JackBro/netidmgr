<h1>Privacy and Security Issues with Fetching Remote Resources</h1>

<p>The <a href="config_idicon.htm">identity icon selection dialog</a>
  presents you with options for using a custom image for an identity,
  including images from remote sources.
</p>

<p>Network Identity Manager
  uses <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384273(VS.85).aspx"
  class="external">WinHTTP<img src="images/link.png"/></a> to fetch
  resources via HTTP with these settings:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The user-agent string is (currently) set
  to <span class="pre">Network Identity Manager</span>.</li>
  <li>Cookies are disabled.</li>
  <li>Automatic authentication is disabled.</li>
  <li>SSL is disabled.  Only plain HTTP connections are allowed.</li>
</ul>

<p>These settings are intended to minimize the set of features that
  are used and to avoid unexpected exposure of information.  Fetching
  a remote resource through Network Identity Manager is similar to
  fetching a resource through any web browser and has similar
  associated risks.</p>

<p>Details about specifc methods that are available for specifying
remote resources are given below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#url">Fetching an image from a URL</a></li>
  <li><a href="#favicon">Fetching a favicon from a domain</a></li>
  <li><a href="#gravatar">Fetching an icon from Gravatar.com</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="url"></a>
<h4>Fetching an image from a URL</h4>

<p>When invoked, Network Identity Manager will attempt to fetch an
image file from the specified URL using an HTTP GET request.</p>

<a name="favicon"></a>
<h4>Fetching a Favicon from a domain</h4>

<p>When invoked, Network Identity Manager will attempt to fetch the
  Favicon associated with the given domain or any parent domains.
  First, the Favicon for the given domain will be queried.  If a
  Favicon is not found, then the Favicon for
  the <span class="pre">www</span> subdomain of the domain will be
  queried.  If an icon is still not found, then the parent domains
  will be queried in the same manner until there is only one
  components left in the domain name.
</p>

<p>For example: if the Favicon
  for <class span="pre">FOO.BAR.EXAMPLE.COM</span> is being requested
  the following sequence of events will occur.</p>

<ol>
  <li>An HTTP GET request for <span class="pre">/favicon.ico</span>
    will be issued to host <span class="pre">FOO.BAR.EXAMPLE.COM</span>.</li>

  <li>Failing which, an HTTP GET request
    for <span class="pre">/favicon.ico</span> will be issued to
    host <span class="pre">WWW.FOO.BAR.EXAMPLE.COM</span>.</li>

  <li>Failing which, an HTTP GET request
    for <span class="pre">/favicon.ico</span> will be issued to
    host <span class="pre">BAR.EXAMPLE.COM</span>.</li>

  <li>Failing which, an HTTP GET request
    for <span class="pre">/favicon.ico</span> will be issued to
    host <span class="pre">WWW.BAR.EXAMPLE.COM</span>.</li>

  <li>Failing which, an HTTP GET request
    for <span class="pre">/favicon.ico</span> will be issued to
    host <span class="pre">EXAMPLE.COM</span>.</li>

  <li>Failing which, an HTTP GET request
    for <span class="pre">/favicon.ico</span> will be issued to
    host <span class="pre">WWW.EXAMPLE.COM</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This method is officially discouraged for fetching Favicons by the
  W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/howto-favicon"
  class="external">as seen here<img src="images/link.png"/></a>.
  However it is used as an interim measure until full support for
  Favicons is implemented.</p>

<a name="gravatar"></a>
<h4>Fetching an icon from Gravatar.com</h4>

<p>Please visit <a href="http://gravatar.com"
                   class="external">Gravatar.com<img src="images/link.png"/></a> for
  details about the Gravatar service and
  their <a href="http://automattic.com/privacy/"
           class="external">Privacy Policy<img src="images/link.png"/></a> and
  the <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/site/terms-of-service"
         class="external">Terms of Service<img src="images/link.png"/></a>.
  The information in this document only applies to how Network Identity
  Manager uses the Gravatar service.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the images downloaded by Network Identity
  Manager using Gravatar.com are only used by the application for the
  purpose of identifying one or more identities.</p>

<p>When an email address is specified for the purpose of fetching the
  image associated with it on Gravatar.com, Network Identity Manager
  assembles a URL in accordance
  with <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/url"
  class="external">the documentation<img src="images/link.png"/></a>
  and fetches 64x64 pixel Jpeg image.  If there is no image associated
  with that email address, then the operation will fail.  No default
  or autogenerated images will be used in thise case.  Network
  Identity Manager does not attempt to validate the email address.</p>

<p>Network Identity Manager, MIT nor Secure-Endpoints are associated
  with Gravatar.com or Automattic.com.</p>

<h3>Security Issues</h3>

<p>
  As always, it is highly recommended that your computer be kept
  up-to-date with the latest security patches and software updates.
  Fetching images from the internet increases the attack surface of
  Network Identity Manager due to the use of following additional
  technologies to fetch and process images:

  <ul>
    <li>Microsoft WinHTTP</li>
    <li>Microsoft GdiPlus</li>
  </ul>
</p>
