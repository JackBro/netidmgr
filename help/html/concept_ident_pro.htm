    <h1>Network Identity Manager Concepts: Identity Provider</h1>

    <p>
      Network Identity Manager relies on plug-ins to provide the
      majority of its functionality.  One of the requirements is that
      there be at least one plug-in that is registered as
      an <strong>identity provider</strong>.  The identity
      provider:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Defines the identity</li>
      <li>Provides the engine that drives the <i>Obtain New Credentials</i> dialog</li>
      <li>Handles identity management tasks such as setting the
        default identity and validating identities on</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      NetIDMgr v2 ships with two identity providers: a Kerberos v5 identity provider
      and a Keystore Identity Provider.
    </p>

    <h4>Kerberos v5 Identity Provider</h4>

    <p>The Kerberos v5 identity provider uses Kerberos principals as
      identities. It obtains Kerberos v5 ticket granting tickets as
      the network credential that represents the identity.</p>

    <p>The default identity is the principal that corresponds to the
      default Kerberos v5 credentials cache.  Changing the default
      Kerberos v5 identity in NetIDMgr has the effect of changing the
      default credentials cache.</p>

      <p class="caption">Plug-in configuration panel showing Kerberos v5 identity provider</p>
    </div>

    <h4>KeyStore Identity Provider</h4>

    <p>Each KeyStore identity corresponds to a single KeyStore. At the
      time of this writing, there is only one KeyStore per user.
      Therefore, on most client installations, there is only one
      KeyStore identity called "My KeyStore", which, by definition, is
      the default KeyStore identity.
    </p>

    <p>When you save passwords in the KeyStore, each identity
      corresponding to the password will become a child of the
      KeyStore identity.  Obtaining new credentials for the KeyStore
      automatically obtains credentials for these child identities.
    </p>

      the KeyStore provider.</p>
