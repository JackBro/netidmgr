<h1>Starting Network Identity Manager</h1>

<h3>Opening the Network Identity Manager window from the notification icon</h3>

<p>Depending on how Network Identity Manager was installed, it may be
  configured with a shortcut in the Startup Folder, or it may require
  a manual start. NetIDMgr is a notification tray application and
  therefore it is not listed in the Microsoft Windows task bar.&nbsp;
  This design is based on the assumption that most users rarely
  interact directly with the application.</p>

  notification icon</p>
</div>

<p>When NetIDMgr is running, it places an icon in the system
  notification area (sometimes referred to as the "system tray") as
  shown in <span class="title">figure 1</span>.  Details about the
  state information represented by the icon can be
  found <a href="use_icon.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Left clicking on this icon executes the default action which either
  changes the view state of the credential list or displays
  the <i>Obtain New Credentials</i> dialog. Right clicking on the icon
  displays a menu.</p>

<h3>Starting Network Identity Manager from the Start Menu</h3>

application shortcut</p>
</div>

<p>If NetIDMgr was not configured to start automatically when you
  login to Windows, then you need to start it either from the
  commandline or the start menu.  The start menu application icon is
  under "Network Identity Manager" or "Kerberos for Windows" as shown
  in <span class="title">figure 2</span>.</p>

<h3>Starting Network Identity Manager from the command line</h3>

<p>Alternatively, you can type 'netidmgr' at a command shell to start
  NetIDMgr as well.  When starting this way, you may specify additional
  <a href="cmdline_netidmgr.htm">command line options</a>.</p>

<h3>Configuring startup options</h3>

<p>
  Note that you can configure options related to the startup of
  NetIDMgr by using the NetIDMgr configuration dialog box.  You can
  use the menu items under the <span class="pre">Options</span> menu
  to invoke the configuration dialog.
</p>

<p>
  Only one instance of NetIDMgr can be running at any one time.
  Attempting to start NetIDMgr while it is still running will not do
  anything, unless you provide any command line options that trigger
  some action in the running application instance.  If more than one
  version of NetIDMgr is installed on the system, and the older
  version is running at the time the newer version is started, the
  older version will exit allowing the newer version to take over.
