<h1>Change Password</h1>

<p>The change password dialog can be invoked using:

  <ul>
    <li>the <a href="menu_credential.htm">Credentials</a> menu.</li>
    <li>the <a href="tb_standard.htm#chpw">Change password button (<img src="images/chpw.bmp" />) on the toolbar</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>The dialog prompts you to change the password for an identity that
  supports password changing.  Both the Kerberos v5 provider and the
  KeyStore provider support changing passwords.
</p>

</div>

<p>Once you select the identity for which you are changing the
  password, you need to enter the current password along with the new
  password twice.  Finally click the <span class="pre">Finish</span>
  button to continue with the password change operation.
</p>

<p>Similar to the <a href="act_new_creds.htm">New credentials
    operation</a>, you can change the target identity using the
    identity selector at the top of the dialog.
</p>

<p>Guidelines for choosing a good password can be
  found <a href="how_to_choose_a_password.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>When you type into the password fields of the dialog box characters
  are replaced with bullets. The program accepts only printable
  characters for new passwords, i.e., characters between ASCII codes
  0x20 and 0x7E.
</p>

<p>When you have entered the new password twice consistently, the
  program attempts to change the password via a dialogue with the
  Kerberos administrative server. Some Kerberos sites, including MIT's
  Athena environment, check the password's strength before allowing
  the change to take place and notifies you if it determines that the
  password is weak.

  <p>The Kerberos v5 provider may prompt you to change the password
    during a <a href="act_new_creds.htm">New credentials</a> operation
    if the KDC indicates that your password has expired and needs to
    be changed.
</div>

<div class="note">
  <img src="images/note.png" alt="Note:" />
  <p>Changing the password of a Kerberos v5 principal might fail if
    Network Address Translation is in use.  Machines with IP addresses
    192.168.x.x, 172.x.x.x or 10.x.x.x are often used in conjunction
    with Network Address Translation.</p>

  <p>This command will not change your local machine password unless
    you login to your computer using a Windows Domain account or
    otherwise authenticate using an MIT Kerberos identity</p>
