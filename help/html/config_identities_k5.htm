    <h1>Global Kerberos v5 Identity Settings</h1>

    <p><img src="images/options-id-global-k5.png" /> </p>

    <p>The global Kerberos v5 settings define default credential
      lifetimes and minimum and maximum values for use in constructing
      the slider controls used to set the lifetimes.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>There are two expiration times associated with Kerberos
      tickets.&nbsp; The first specifies the length of the time period
      during which the tickets are valid for use.&nbsp; The second
      specifies the length of the renewable lifetime.&nbsp; Valid
      Kerberos tickets may have their valid use lifetime repeatedly
      extended up until the renewable lifetime expires.&nbsp; The
      settings on this page are used to configure default lifetime
      values for NetIdMgr to use when requesting Kerberos tickets from
      the Kerberos server (key distribution center).&nbsp; The
      Kerberos server may issue tickets with shorter lifetimes than
      were requested.</p>
    <p>The <b>Renewable</b>, <b>Forwardable</b>, and <b>
        Addressless</b> options determine whether or not new
        identities default to obtaining Kerberos v5 tickets with these
        options.</p>
    <p>When <b>Forwardable </b>tickets are received from the Kerberos
      Server, these tickets can be forwarded to a remote host when you
      connect via telnet, ssh, ftp, rlogin, or similar
      applications.&nbsp; When tickets are forwarded, there is no need
      to obtain Kerberos tickets again to access Kerberized services
      on the remote host.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Forwardable</b> tickets are
      often required when authenticating to a remote host using ssh or
      ftp when the remote host requires the ability to authenticate to
      a remote file system such as AFS.</p>
    <p>When <b>Renewable</b> tickets are received from the Kerberos
      Server, the ticket lifetimes may be renewed without prompting
      the user for her password.&nbsp; This allows Kerberos tickets to
      be issued with short lifetimes allowing compromised accounts to
      be disabled on short notice without requiring the user to enter
      a password every few hours.&nbsp; When combined with <b>
      Automatic Ticket Renewal</b>, NetIdMgr can maintain valid
      tickets for a week, a month, or longer by automatically renewing
      tickets prior to their expiration.&nbsp; The ability to renew
      tickets without a password is limited by the ticket’s
      renewable lifetime as issued by the Kerberos Server.</p>
    <p>When <b>Addressless</b> is selected, the tickets do not contain
      IP address information.&nbsp; This enables the tickets to be
      used from behind Network Address Translators which are
      frequently found in Cable and DSL Modems.</p>
    <p>The minimum and maximum ranges are used by the ticket
      initialization dialog box when constructing the Lifetime and
      Renewable Lifetime sliders.&nbsp; These sliders can be used to
      modify the requested ticket lifetimes when Kerberos tickets are
      initialized.</p>
