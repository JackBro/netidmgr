<h1>Network Identity Manager Concepts</h1>

<p>The Network Identity Manager (NetIDMgr) organizes and manages
  credentials based on how they identify the user to network
  services. It is assumed that each
  <a href="concept_credential.htm">credential</a> will uniquely
  identify the user to a service as a single authentication
  <a href="concept_identity.htm">identity</a>.  When using a Kerberos v5
  identity the authentication name is the Kerberos principal name.
</p>

<p>At it's core, NetIDMgr does not possess any knowledge about
  specific credentials that might be available to the user or how to
  manage them.  It relies on several types of provider plug-ins to obtain
  the required information and to carry out credential management tasks.
  One primary task is to identify and manage identities.  These
  services are provided by a class of plug-ins called
  <a href="concept_ident_pro.htm">identity providers</a>.
  Information about individual credentials are managed
  by <a href="concept_cred_pro.htm">credential providers</a>.  Other
  plug-in classes may extend the functionality of these plug-ins or
  extend the functionality of NetIDMgr.
