    <h1>Configuration</h1>
    <p>All Network Identity Manager configuration options can be
      accessed via the
      <a href="menu_options.htm"><span class="pre">Options</span></a>
      menu. The available configuration panels are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<p><a href="config_general.htm">
            <span class="title">General</span></a>: General application options for NetIDMgr.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p><a href="config_appearance.htm">
            <span class="title">Appearance</span></a>: Allows you to set the font used by 
	  NetIDMgr.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p><span class="title">Identities</span>: <a href="config_identities.htm">Default
	  settings for all identities</a>
	  and <a href="config_identity.htm">settings for each
	  identity</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p><a href="config_notifications.htm">
            <span class="title">Notifications</span></a>: Notification and
	  timer options.  NetIDMgr can issue warnings when credentials
	  are about to expire. This configuration panel allows you to
	  set the thresholds at which these warnings are issued. For
	  example, if the warning timeout is set for 10 minutes,
	  NetIDMgr will issue a warning 10 minutes before a credential
	  expires.</p>
	<p>The panel also allows you to control the credentials renew
	  timer. If the timer is disabled, NetIDMgr will not
	  automatically attempt to renew credentials.  If
	  the <span class="pre">Renew at half life intervals when
	  possible</span> option is set, then the timer will expire
	  after the credential has less than half its lifetime
	  left. If the renewal operation fails, it will attempt
	  another renwal after half of the remaining liftime is over
	  (i.e. when the credential has less than 1/4 of its original
	  lifetime left) and so on. </p>
	</li>
      <li>
	<p><a href="config_plugins.htm">
            <span class="title">Plug-ins</span></a>: Enable/disable and
	  check the status of registered plug-ins. Enabling or
	  disabling a plug-in only takes effect after a restart of
	  NetIDMgr.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p><a href="config_k5.htm">
            <span class="title">Kerberos v5</span></a>: Kerberos v5 Credential Provider Configuration</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Using the Options Dialog</h3>

    <p>
      The options dialog includes an outline of available
      configuration panels on the left.  Clicking on any item in the
      outline takes you to the corresponding configuration panel.
    </p>

    <div class="sidebar" style="width: 420px">
      <img src="images/options-outline-w-flag.png" alt="Configuration dialog outline with flag"/>
      <p class="caption"><span class="title">Figure 1:</span>
      Configuration dialog outline with flag indicating that there are
      unsaved changes (left) and flag indicating that changes were
      saved successfully.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Many of the changes you make on the configuration panels are not
      applied immediately.  Instead, any unsaved changes are indicated
      in the outline by an orange flag marker as shown
      in <span class="title">Figure 1</span>.  You can save pending
      changes by clicking the <span class="pre">Apply</span> button.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once changes are successfully saved, the flag changes to a
      green check (also shown in <span class="title">Figure 1</span>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Hovering the mouse cursor over the flag icon will cause a tool
      tip to be displayed explaining whether the corresponding
      configuration item was modified or not.
    </p>

    <h3>Configuration Information</h3>

    <p>
      Network Identity Manager stores configuration information in the
      user and machine registry hives.  Per user settings are always
      saved in the user's registry hive, while per machine settings
      are saved by the installer in the machine registry hive.
    </p>

    <p>
      During normal operation, per-machine registry information is
      considered read-only by Network Identity Manager.  Therefore,
      all the configuration changes you make using this dialog will be
      per-user changes.  The changes will not be visible to or affect
      other users of the system.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, this restriciton may not apply for all plug-ins.  Third
      party plug-ins may choose to store and modify global
      configuration information.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <img src="images/note.png" alt="Note:" />
      <p>
        Using <span class="pre">REGEDIT</span> or other registry
        modification tool to change the registry keys that are being
        used while Network Identity Manager is running is highly
        discouraged and may lead to unpredictable behavior.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Information about which registry keys are used by Network
      Identity Manager can be found in
      the <a href="registry.htm">Registry Reference</a> section.
