    <p>The KeyStore provider is a password storage plug-in for Network
      Identity Manager.  Using a master password, the
      provider can secure a set of passwords that can be used to
      obtain initial credentials for a set of identities.
    </p>

    <p>Network Identity Manager 2.0 introduces the capability to
      integrate password management into the credentials aquisition
      workflow.  This is used by the KeyStore provider to simplify the
      process of storing and using passwords.
    </p>

    <p>During normal initial credential acquisition, you can elect to
      save the password you have entered.  If necessary, the KeyStore
      provider will prompt for the master password or prompt you to
      set up a master password if you haven't already done so.</p>

    <p>Once a set of passwords have been saved into the KeyStore, you
      can initiate a new credentials acquisition for the KeyStore
      identity.  Once you provide the master password, the KeyStore
      provider will unlock the stored passwords and obtain initial
      credentials for the identities corresponding to the stored
      passwords.</p>
