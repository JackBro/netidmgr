    <h1>Per identity General configuration</h1>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="images/options-id-single.png" />
    </div>

    <p>The General page contains a <b>Remove
        Identity</b> button that can be used to delete this Identity
      from the Network Identity Manager.</p>

    <p>The <b>Monitor credential expiration</b> setting determines
      whether or not NetIdMgr should monitor the credential lifetimes
      and issue expiration notifications.&nbsp;&nbsp; This value is
      used as the default for all new identities.</p>

    <p>The <b>Automatically renew</b> setting determines if <i>
        renewable</i> credentials are automatically renewed prior to
        expiration.&nbsp; This value is used as the default for all
        new identities.</p>

    <p>The <b>Always show in the credentials list (Pinned)</b> setting
      determines whether new identities are always pinned within the
      credentials list.&nbsp; A pinned identity will always be
      displayed regardless of whether or not there are credentials
      associated with it.</p>

    <div class="note">

      <p>
        Adding or removing an identity in the configuration panel only
        has the effect of adding or removing the identity to or from
        the list of identities for which configuration information is
        maintained.</p>

      <p>
        If an identity being removed has a saved password in a key
        store (see <a href="act_new_creds_persistence.htm">Password
        Persistence</a>), then the MyKeystore plug-in will remove the
        stored password as well.

    <p>
      The <span class="pre">Change icon</span> button invokes the
      <a href="config_idicon.htm">identity icon dialog</a> that you
      can use to change the icon associated with the identity.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can revert back to the default icon by clicking on
      the <span class="pre">Reset icon</span> button.  Note that
      changing the identity icon is an immediate action that takes
      effect immediately.  You don't need to click on
      the <span class="pre">Apply</span> button.
