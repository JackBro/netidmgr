    <p>The <span class="pre">Renew automatically at</span> check box determines whether
      or not renewable tickets will be renewed by NetIdMgr when they
      reach the specified time remaining.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>By default the <span class="pre">Renew at half life intervals
        when possible</span> option is enabled.  When enabled, Network
        Identity Manager will trigger a renewal attempt for an
        identity when its remaining lifetime reaches a half of its
        original lifetime.  If the renewal is unsuccessful, another
        attempt will be made to renew the identity after another one
        half of the remaining lifetime has elapsed.  This process
        continues until the identity is successfully renews or the
        remaining lifetime is too short for a renewal attempt.
    </p>
    <p>The <span class="pre">Initial warning at</span> check box determines whether or
      not a warning will be issued when the specified time remaining
      is reached.</p>
    <p>The <span class="pre">Final warning at</span> check box determines whether or not
      a warning will be issued when the specified time remaining is
      reached.</p>
    <p>Notifications are performed in two ways.&nbsp; First, icons are
      displayed next to the affected credentials in the flags column
      of the display.&nbsp; Second, a balloon tip is displayed off of
      the NetIdMgr taskbar notification area icon.</p>
