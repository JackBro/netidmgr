    <h1>Per identity Kerberos v5 configuration</h1>

    <div class="imgbox"><img src="images/options-id-single-k5.png" /> </div>

    <p>Kerberos v5 options include the ability to select the ticket
      lifetime as well as renew and forwarding.  The Kerberos v5 ticket
      granting ticket represents the selected identity.  As such,
      obtaining a Kerberos v5 ticket is mandatory.</p>

    <p>The <span class="pre">Credential lifetime</span> option can
      control how long the initial ticket will be valid for.</p>

    <p>When <span class="pre">Forwardable tickets</span> are received
      from the Kerberos Server, these tickets can be forwarded to a
      remote host when you connect via telnet, ssh, ftp, rlogin, or
      similar applications.  When tickets are forwarded, there is no
      need to obtain Kerberos tickets again to access Kerberized
      services on the remote host.  Forwardable tickets are often
      required when authenticating to a remote host using ssh or ftp
      when the remote host requires the ability to authenticate to a
      remote file system such as AFS.
    </p>

    <p>When <span class="pre">Renewable tickets</span> are received
      from the Kerberos Server, the ticket lifetimes may be renewed
      without prompting the user for her password.  This allows Kerberos
      tickets to be issued with short lifetimes allowing compromised
      accounts to be disabled on short notice without requiring the user
      to enter a password every few hours.  When combined with Automatic
      Ticket Renewal, NetIdMgr can maintain valid tickets for a week, a
      month, or longer by automatically renewing tickets prior to their
      expiration.  The ability to renew tickets without a password is
      limited by the ticket's renewable lifetime as issued by the
      Kerberos Server.
    </p>

    <p>When <span class="pre">Addressless</span> is selected, the
      tickets do not contain IP address information.  This enables the
      tickets to be used from behind Network Address Translators which
      are frequently found in Cable and DSL Modems.
    </p>

    <p>The <span class="pre">Credential cache</span> setting controls
      the location of the Kerberos v5 credentials cache where the
      obtained credentials will be placed.  By default, the Kerberos
      v5 provider places credentials in
      an <span class="pre">API:</span> (in-memory) cache.  However,
      you can specify any type of cache supported by the Kerberos for
      Windows.  The <span class="pre">Browse for FILE: cache</span>
      button allows you to browse for an existing file or specify the
      name for a new file which will be used as a FILE: cache.  If the
      file does not exist, it will be created the next time you obtain
      new credentials for this identity.  The cache is also
      automatically added to the list of FILE: caches that are
      monitored by Network Identity Manager.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <img src="images/note.png" alt="Note:" />
      <p>The Kerberos v5 provider does not check whether an existing
        FILE: cache is valid when setting the credentials cache for an
        identity.</p>
