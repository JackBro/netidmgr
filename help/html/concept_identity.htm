<h1>Network Identity Manager Concepts: Identity</h1>

<p>While there are many approaches to defining what an identity is, as
  far as the Network Identity Manager (NetIDMgr) is concerned, an
  identity is the unique user identifier that is accepted by a network
  service. Each credential that is managed by NetIDMgr is assumed to
  map to a single identity. The collection of credentials that map to
  the same identity are determined to belong to that identity. </p>

<h3>Default Identity</h3>

</div>

<p>The default identity is the identity that will be used by
  applications when a specific identity is not requested. The Kerberos
  v5 provider plug-in will mark the credential cache that contains the default
  identity as the default credentials cache for the current logon
  session.</p>

<p>Most applications that implement GSS-API or Kerberos v5
  authentication assume that there is only one Kerberos v5 credential
  cache and one identity in use by the user at a time.&nbsp; These
  applications use the default identity.&nbsp; In general, if the
  application does not have a configuration option permitting the
  specification of a Kerberos v5 principal, the default identity will
  be used.</p>

<p>The default identity is indicated in the credentials display using
  a star icon, as illustrated in the screenshot above.</p>

<p><img src="images/task.png"/> You can change the default identity by
  clicking on the star icon next to the identity.</p>
