    <h1>Credentials Display</h1>

    <p>The Network Identity Manager credentials display, when open,
      displays the current status of your network identities and
      provides you the tools necessary to obtain new credentials,
      renew existing credentials, destroy credentials, change your
      password, configure the behavior of your network identities, and
      access the on-line help.  There are two primary views of network
      identity status: <b>basic</b> and <b>advanced</b>.

    <p>The basic view provides status information of the currently
      available identities whereas the advanced view provides more
      detailed information of all the active credentials.</p>

    <p>You can switch between the two views
      using <span class="pre">F7</span> or using
      the <a href="menu_view.htm"><span class="pre">View
      menu</span></a>.</p>

    <h3>Basic view</h3>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="images/screen_main_wnd_basic.png" usemap="#map_basic" />
      <p class="caption"><span class="pre">Figure 1</span>: Network Identity Manager Basic View</p>
    </div>

    <map name="map_basic">
      <area shape = "rect" coords = "4,23,158,38" href = "menu_all.htm">
      <area shape = "rect" coords = "6,39,261,67" href = "tb_standard.htm">
      <area shape = "rect" coords = "6,68,300,268" href = "#ident-display">
    </map>

    <p>The basic view gives a brief overview of the active identities.
      The contents of the <a href="#ident-display">identity display
      area</a> is equivalent to the advanced view with the exception
      of the credential list line which gives the number and type of
      credentials available for each identity.
    </p>

    <h3>Advanced View</h3>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="images/screen_main_wnd.png" usemap="#map_adv" />
      <p class="caption"><span class="pre">Figure 1</span>. Network
        Identity Manager Advanced View</p>
    </div>

    <map name="map_adv">
      <area shape = "rect" coords = "4,21,161,38" href = "menu_all.htm">
      <area shape = "rect" coords = "5,39,260,67" href = "tb_standard.htm">
      <area shape = "rect" coords = "6,66,415,83" href = "#header">
      <area shape = "rect" coords = "5,85,420,453" href = "#ident-display">
    </map>

    <p>The advanced credentials view organizes them grouped by
      identity name, credential type and then by location. Each
      credential is then shown under each group heading sorted by the
      credential name. The default headings for the credential view
      provides you with a minimal amount of information to reduce
      clutter.</p>

    <a name="header"/>
    <p>You can add columns to the display using
      the <span class="pre">Choose columns...</span> action on
      the <span class="pre"><a href="menu_view.htm">View</a></span>
      menu or by right-clicking on the header as shown
      in <span class="pre">Figure 2</span>.</p>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="images/screen_main_wnd_header_menu.png" alt="" />
      <p class="caption"><span class="pre">Figure 2</span>: Menu for choosing display columns</p>
    </div>

    <p>In addition, you can click on the column header to change the
      sort order for each field or double-click on a column header to
      toggle grouping.  You may also drag fields to change the column
      ordering.</p>

    <p>The <span class="pre"><a href="menu_view.htm">View
      menu</a> </span> lets you switch between several pre-defined
      layouts for the advanced credentials view.  For more
      information, see <a href="use_layout.htm">Managing the
      credentials view layout</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Expiration states</h4>

    <p>The header backgrounds and the credential rows change color if
      the credentials are about to expire or are expired. </p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><span style="background-color:rgb(213,255,5)">Headers</span>
          mean that credentials at that level will expire unless
          renewed.  The threshold for this can be set as
          the <span class="pre">Warn</span> parameter in
          the <a href="config_notifications.htm"><span class="pre">Notifications</span>
          configuration panel</a>.  The default threshold for this
          indicator is 10 minutes.</p>

        <div class="note">
          <img src="images/note.png" alt="Note:" />
          <p>Attempts to renew renewable credentials are performed at
            half-life intervals and 15 minutes before expiration
            automatically, by default.  The actual time at which a renewal is
            performed can be changed in
            the <a href="config_notifications.htm">Notifications</a>
            configuration panel.  Automatic renewals can also be disabled.
          </p>
        </div>

      </li>

      <li><p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,172,5)">Headers</span>
          mean that credentials at that level will expire shortly. The
          default threshold for this warning is 5 minutes before
          credential expiration.  This can be changed using the
          <span class="pre">Warn again</span> parameter in
          the <a href="config_notifications.htm"><span class="pre">Notifications</span>
          configuration panel</a>.</p> </li>

      <li><p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,47,5)">Headers</span> mean
          that the credentials at that level have expired.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <a name="ident-display"/>
    <h4>Identity display</h4>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="images/screen_main_wnd_identity.png" alt="Identity outline" />
      <p class="caption"><span class="pre">Figure 3:</span> Annotated sample identity outline</p>
    </div>

    <p>The identity display has the following components:

      <dl class="options">
        <dt>Expand widget</dt>
        <dd>Clicking on the expand widget toggles the display of
          contained credential information.</dd>

        <dt>Identity icon</dt>
        <dd>This is the icon associated with the identity.  An icon
          will be assigned by default based on the type of the
          identity.  You can customize the icon using
          the <a href="config_idicon.htm"><span class="pre">Choose icon</span></a>
          button of
          the <a href="config_identity.htm"><span class="pre">Identity
          configuration</span> dialog</a>.</dd>

        <dt>Default identity widget</dt>
        <dd>The <a href="concept_identity.htm">default identity</a> is
          indicated in the credentials display using a filled star
          icon (<img src="images/star-1-hi.png" />).  A non-default
          identity has an empty start icon
          (<img src="images/star-0-hi.png" />).  If the identity is
          not the default, clicking on the star will make it the
          default.</dd>

        <dt>Identity name</dt>
        <dd>This is the display name for the identity.</dd>

        <dt>Identity type</dt>
        <dd>The type of the identity as reported by the identity provider.</dd>

        <dt>Lifetime</dt>
        <dd>The remaining lifetime of the identity credentials.  For
          Kerberos v5 identities, this is the lifetime of the initial
          ticket granting ticket. The lifetime is always shown in
          relative form.  If the identity credentials have already
          expired, the lifetime will be displayed
          as <span class="pre">(Expired)</span></dd>

        <dt>Pin</dt>
        <dd>Normally, the only identities that will be displayed on
          the credentials window are those that have credentials
          associated with them.  However, if an identity is pinned, it
          will always be displayed, even if there are no credentials.
          The push pin icon indicates whether this identity is pinned
          (<img src="images/wdg_stuck_hi.bmp" />) or not pinned
          (<img src="images/wdg_stick_hi.bmp" />).  Clicking on the
          icon can toggle the pinned state.</dd>

        <dt>Lifetime meter</dt>
        <dd>Provides a visual indication of the remaining lifetime in
          proportion to the total lifetime.  Clicking on the lifetime
          meter starts a renewal of the identity.</dd>
      </dl>
    </p>

    <h3>Working with credentials</h3>

    <h4>Selection</h4>

    <p>You can select identities and credentials using either the
      cursor keys on the keyboard or by clicking using the mouse.  The
      credentials display follows the usual selection actions on
      Windows:

      <ul>
        <li>Clicking on an outline level or credential selects it.</li>

        <li><span class="pre">Ctrl + &lt;click&gt;</span> toggles the
          selection state of the item you click on, without affecting
          the selection state of the other items.</li>

        <li><span class="pre">Shift + &lt;click&gt;</span> extends a
          selection from where the cursor was last, to the item you
          clicked on selecting everything in-between inclusive.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Alternatively, you can use the keyboard to move around the
      credentials display and select identities and credentials.

      <ul>
        <li>The cursor movement keys move the selection cursor while
          selecting only the item that the cursor is currently on.  If
          the cursor is on an outline level, all items included in the
          outline level will be selected.</li>

        <li>The <span class="pre">PgUp, PgDn, Home, End</span> keys
          take you up one page at a time, down one page at a time, to
          the first item in the display and the last item
          repectively.</li>

        <li><span class="pre">Shift + &lt;movement&gt;</span> extends
          the selection by selecting everything from the cursor position
          to the newly selected item inclusive.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Invoking the <a href="act_destroy_creds.htm">Destroy
        credentials</a> action while a set of credentials are selected
      results in an attempt to destroy all of the selected
      credentials.</p>

    <p>Other actions, such as the <a href="act_new_creds.htm">New
        credentials</a> action are only affected by the cursor
        selection.</p>
