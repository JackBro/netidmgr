    <h1>Configuration of default settings for all identities</h1>

    <p>The <span class="pre">Identities</span> configuration panel
      allows you to set the defaults that will be used for all
      identities. However, most of the settings displayed here can be
      overridden with specific per-identity settings. </p>
    <p>The panel will have a number of sub panels (or tabs)
      corresponding to each plug-in that maintains per-identity
      configuration. </p>
    <p>A list of identities for which configuration information is
      maintained will be shown under the
      main <span class="pre">Identities</span> configuration panel
      name.  Each of these correspond to
      a <a href="config_identity.htm">per identity</a> configuration
      panel. </p>

    <div class="note">
      <img src="images/note.png" alt="Note:"/>
      <p>
        Adding or removing an identity in the configuration panel only
        has the effect of adding or removing the identity to or from
        the list of identities for which configuration information is
        maintained.</p>

      <p>
        If an identity being removed has a saved password in a key
        store (see <a href="act_new_creds_persistence.htm">Password
        Persistence</a>), then the MyKeystore plug-in will remove the
        stored password as well.

    <h3>Global Identity Settings</h3>

    <p><img src="images/options-id-global.png" /> </p>
    <p>There are three general settings that can be used to set global
      defaults.</p>
    <p>The <b>Monitor credential expiration</b> setting determines
      whether or not NetIdMgr should monitor the credential lifetimes
      and issue expiration notifications.&nbsp;&nbsp; This value is
      used as the default for all new identities.</p>
    <p>The <b>Automatically renew</b> setting determines if <i>
        renewable</i> credentials are automatically renewed prior to
        expiration.&nbsp; This value is used as the default for all
        new identities.</p>
    <p>The <b>Always show in the credentials list (Pinned)</b> setting
      determines whether new identities are always pinned within the
      credentials list.&nbsp; A pinned identity will always be
      displayed regardless of whether or not there are credentials
      associated with it.</p>

    <h3>Global Kerberos v5 Identity Settings</h3>

    <p><img src="images/options-id-global-k5.png" /> </p>
    <p>The global Kerberos v5 settings define default credential
      lifetimes and minimum and maximum values for use in constructing
      the slider controls used to set the lifetimes.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>There are two expiration times associated with Kerberos
      tickets.&nbsp; The first specifies the length of the time period
      during which the tickets are valid for use.&nbsp; The second
      specifies the length of the renewable lifetime.&nbsp; Valid
      Kerberos tickets may have their valid use lifetime repeatedly
      extended up until the renewable lifetime expires.&nbsp; The
      settings on this page are used to configure default lifetime
      values for NetIdMgr to use when requesting Kerberos tickets from
      the Kerberos server (key distribution center).&nbsp; The
      Kerberos server may issue tickets with shorter lifetimes than
      were requested.</p>
    <p>The <b>Renewable</b>, <b>Forwardable</b>, and <b>
        Addressless</b> options determine whether or not new
        identities default to obtaining Kerberos v5 tickets with these
        options.</p>
    <p>When <b>Forwardable </b>tickets are received from the Kerberos
      Server, these tickets can be forwarded to a remote host when you
      connect via telnet, ssh, ftp, rlogin, or similar
      applications.&nbsp; When tickets are forwarded, there is no need
      to obtain Kerberos tickets again to access Kerberized services
      on the remote host.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Forwardable</b> tickets are
      often required when authenticating to a remote host using ssh or
      ftp when the remote host requires the ability to authenticate to
      a remote file system such as AFS.</p>
    <p>When <b>Renewable</b> tickets are received from the Kerberos
      Server, the ticket lifetimes may be renewed without prompting
      the user for her password.&nbsp; This allows Kerberos tickets to
      be issued with short lifetimes allowing compromised accounts to
      be disabled on short notice without requiring the user to enter
      a password every few hours.&nbsp; When combined with <b>
      Automatic Ticket Renewal</b>, NetIdMgr can maintain valid
      tickets for a week, a month, or longer by automatically renewing
      tickets prior to their expiration.&nbsp; The ability to renew
      tickets without a password is limited by the ticket’s
      renewable lifetime as issued by the Kerberos Server.</p>
    <p>When <b>Addressless</b> is selected, the tickets do not contain
      IP address information.&nbsp; This enables the tickets to be
      used from behind Network Address Translators which are
      frequently found in Cable and DSL Modems.</p>
    <p>The minimum and maximum ranges are used by the ticket
      initialization dialog box when constructing the Lifetime and
      Renewable Lifetime sliders.&nbsp; These sliders can be used to
      modify the requested ticket lifetimes when Kerberos tickets are
      initialized.</p>

    <h3>Global Kerberos v4 Identity Settings</h3>

    <p><img src="images/options-id-global-k4.png" /> </p>

    <p>When the <b>Obtain Kerberos v4 credentials</b> button is
      checked, NetIdMgr will attempt to retrieve Kerberos v4
      credentials when ticket initialization, renewal, or importation
      is performed. &nbsp;Kerberos realms are increasingly configured
      to support only Kerberos v5 (e.g., Windows Active Directory
      Domains.)&nbsp; If the realms you use do not support Kerberos v4
      it is suggested that this button be unchecked.</p>
    <p>Be aware that only the default identity can obtain Kerberos v4
      credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp; This limitation is due to the inability
      of Kerberos v4 applications on Microsoft Windows to specify a
      credentials cache. </p>
