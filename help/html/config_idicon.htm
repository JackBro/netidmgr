    <h1>Identity Icon Selection</h1>

    <p>
      Starting with Network Identity Manager 2.0, you can customize
      the icon displayed next to an identity.  This dialog lets you
      pick an image of your choice from your computer, or from a web
      page.
    <p>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="images/options-id-icon-file.png"/>
      <p class="caption">Identity icon selection dialog</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      There are currently four ways to specify an image file to be
      used as the basis of your icon:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><span class="title">Use picture from file</span>: If the
          image is already on your computer, then you can use
          the <span class="pre">Browse</span> button to locate the
          file.  Once selected, the image will be loaded into the area
          on the left.
        </p></li>

      <li><p><span class="title">Fetch from URL</span>: Fetches an
          image from the internet.  Currently,
          only <span class="pre">http://</span> URLs are accepted and
          the URL must locate the image directly.  Once the URL is
          entered, click on the <span class="pre">Go</span> button to
          retrieve the image into the crop area</p></li>

      <li><p><span class="title">Favicon for domain</span>: Attempts
          to fetch the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon"
          class="external">favicon<img src="images/link.png"/></a> for
          a domain.  If the identity is associated with a domain, it
          will be pre-filled for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the listed domain doesn't have a favicon, the application
          will attempt to fetch the favicon for the parent domains of
          the specified domain.
        </p></li>

      <li><p><span class="title">Gravatar for email address</span>:
          Attempts to download the <a href="http://gravatar.com"
          class="external">Gravatar<img src="images/link.png"/></a>
          corresponding to the specified email address.  If a likely
          email address is already associated with the identity, it
          will be pre-filled for you.
        </p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once you specify the image file to use, NetIDMgr will load the
      image into the crop area on the left side of the dialog.  You
      can drag the borders of the crop rectangle to select the portion
      of the image you would like to use as your icon.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are satisfied with your new icon, you can click
      the <span class="pre">Ok</span> button to set the new icon.
    </p>

    <h4>Supported Image Formats</h4>

    <p>The following image formats are currently supported:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="title">BMP</span>: Windows bitmap files</li>
        <li><span class="title">JPG</span></li>
        <li><span class="title">PNG</span></li>
        <li><span class="title">ICO</SPAN>: Windows icon files</li>
        <li><span class="title">EXE,DLL</span>: Icon and bitmap
          resources embedded in .EXE and .DLL files can also be used.
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Privacy and Security Issues with fetching identity icons from the web</h4>

    <p>
      All three methods of fetching the identity icon from the web
      outlined above raise privacy and security concerns.  These are
      detailed in the <a href="wnd_icons_privacy.htm">Privacy and
      Security Issues</a> page.
