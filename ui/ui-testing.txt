
User Interface Testing
----------------------

This document provides an outline of user interface tests to run
manually (or automatically, some day).

* Command line

** Credential actions

   These should be tested twice.  Once with a running instance of NIM
   and once without.  The outcome on both runs should be the same.
   
*** -i

    Should show the new credentials dialog with the default identity
    already preselected.

    - [ ] Fresh installation with no default identity.

    - [ ] Invoked with aliases (--kinit or -kinit)

*** -a

    Should behave identically to -i if no identity credentials are
    present for the default identity.

    - [ ] Invoked with aliases (--autoinit or -autoinit)

*** -r

    Should renew all renewable identities.

    - [ ] Should do nothing if there are no renewable identities.

    - [ ] No errors reported for non-renewable identities.

    - [ ] Invoked with aliases (--renew or -renew)

*** -m

    Import from MSLSA cache.

    - [ ] Should do nothing if there is no identity to import.

    - [ ] Invoked with aliases (--import or -import)

*** -d

    Destroy the default identity

    - [ ] Should do nothing if no credentials for default identity.

    - [ ] Invoked with aliases (--destroy or -destroy)

** Other

*** -x

    Exit the running instance.

    - [ ] Should do nothing if no running instance.

    - [ ] Invoked with aliases( --exit or -exit)

*** --minimized

    - [ ] Should start NIM minimized if not already running

    - [ ] Nothing if it is already running.

*** --hide

    - [ ] Hide the running instance

    - [ ] Nothing if it isn't already running

    - [ ] Nothing if it is already hidden.

*** --show

    - [ ] Unhide the running instance.

    - [ ] Nothing if it is already shown.

    - [ ] Nothing if it isn't already running.

*** Anything else

    Any other command line option should display the command line
    options dialog.

    - [ ] Shows command line options dialog.

    - [ ] Doesn't start NIM.
