Network Identity Manager
========================

Version 1.99.26.225 (Pre v2.0 Beta 2a)
--------------------------------------

Kerberos v5:

  - Fix a race condition where the initial credentials listing can be
    attempted before the identity provider has finished intializing.
    In this case, the credentials listing will fail at first and if
    the --autoinit option is used, Network Identity Manager may
    display the new credentials dialog even when the user has
    credentials.

  - Be more descriptive with logging Kerberos v5 error codes.  New log
    entries are more verbose and include description of the error as
    well as the error code.

Application:

  - Debug log file now includes details about the process token for
    the Network Identity Manager process.  This is to help identify
    recurrent problems with restricted tokens on Vista and Windows 7.

User documentation:

  - Fix broken links.

  - Explain Kerberos v5 proxiable tickets.

  - Explain UI changes in identity icon dialog.

  - Changes to registry documentation layout and content.

Version 1.99.25.217 (Pre v2.0 Beta 2)
-------------------------------------

Changes since 1.99.24.128 (Pre v2.0 Beta 1)

KeyStore:

  - Master key lifetime can now be configured.  It can also be set
    to never expire.

Application:

  - Support for non-expiring identities.

  - Identity icon selection dialog now makes HTTP requests
    asynchronously.  The UI reports any errors that may occur during
    an HTTP fetch and provides a 'Stop' button to abort lengthy
    operations.

Kerberos v5:

  - Added UI controls for setting the 'Proxiable' flag for a new
    TGT.  The setting can be controlled as a global default and as a
    per-identity setting.

Bug fixes:

  - Handling of custom menus was fixed to avoid a situation where
    the wrong submenu may be displayed for an action.

  - Fixed several memory leaks.

  - The generated description for the default keystore had an
    unexpanded insertion sequence.

  - Saved originals of an identity icon image may have a different
    resolution than the source image and may not matched the saved
    crop rectangle.

User documentation:

  - Add missing how_to_choose_a_password.htm topic.

  - Add a section describing the format of the debug log file.

Source:

  - Updated copyright information.

  - Updated developer documentation.

  - Switch to khm_int32 for time intervals in khui_tracker controls
    to preserve ABI compatibility.

  - Introduce context menu notifications for credentials related
    context menus.  Plug-ins can now customize credentials context
    menus on a per-identity or per-credential basis.

  - Added LICENSE, README.xml and README.txt containing build
    instructions.

  - Moved to WiX 3.0 for building MSI based installers.

  - Refactored installers to generate .wixlibs for each plug-in.
