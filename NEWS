Network Identity Manager
========================

Version 2.0.102.907 (Release)
-----------------------------

KeyStore:

  - Proactively indicate password mismatches in the password change
    dialog.

Bug fixes:

  - Fix a potential deadlock when displaying the configuration dialog.

  - Set all certificate identities as initializable to fix backward
    compatibility in certificate provider plug-in.

  - Fix character encoding in Kerberos v5 plug-in configuration
    dialog.

  - Fix race condition during notification of credential operations
    that was causing some notifications to not be delivered.

  - Don't show the 'Back' button during credentials acquisition.

  - Don't hide the new credentials wizard if there is an error to be
    displayed.

  - Fix background erasing for credentials display and notification
    windows.

  - Modal alerts are now always displayed in a window.  Previously, it
    was possible for a modal alert to be displayed as a balloon.

  - Prevent the desktop window from being invalidated when displaying
    an alert windows.

  - Suppress unnecessary alerts during new credentials acquisition.
    It was possible for a credentials acquisition error to be
    displayed twice to the user.

  - Attempts to renew identities are now strictly limited to
    identities that have renewable credentials.

  - The time stamp displays in the credentials display may at times
    show stale values shortly after a new credentials acquisition.

Source:

  - Support building with Microsoft Windows SDK v7.

  - Update the credprov template to depend on an identity provider.

  - Support install-local target for Kerberos v5 and Kerberos v4
    plug-ins during development.

  - Fix for automatic detection of Windows SDKs.  In some instances,
    the setupbuild.cmd script would fail to set paths properly.

  - LoadFuncs is now built as part of the Network Identity Manager
    source tree to avoid mismatched runtime library dependencies.

Version 2.0.0.304 (Release)
---------------------------

Application:

  - Preserve expanded state of credentials display outlines so that
    newly obtained credentials aren't hidden from view.

  - Suppress modal error dialogs when a plug-in can't be loaded due to
    missing dependencies.

Version 1.99.27.227 (Pre v2.0 Beta 3)
--------------------------------------

Application:

  - Identity and credential property sheets no longer display empty
    properties.

  - Debug log file includes details about the process token for the
    Network Identity Manager process.  This is to help identify
    recurrent problems with restricted tokens on Vista and Windows 7.

  - Redundant change notifications have been suppressed within in the
    Network Identity Manager framework.

Kerberos v5:

  - Logged Kerberos v5 errors now include the description as well as
    the code.

User documentation:

  - Broken links have been fixed.

  - Includes explanation of Kerberos v5 proxiable tickets.

  - Explains UI changes in identity icon dialog.

  - Registry documentation layout and content have been revised.

Bug fixes:

  - A race condition where the initial credentials listing can be
    attempted before the identity provider has finished intializing
    has been fixed.  Earlier, the credentials listing will fail at
    first and if the `--autoinit` option is used, Network Identity
    Manager may display the new credentials dialog even when the user
    has credentials.

Source:

  - On debug builds, we now report the thread ID and name using
    OutputDebugString() so that this information can appear in the
    application debug log.

  - On debug builds, the decoding of KMSG_CRED messages has been
    fixed.  Log entries for these messages used to have an incorrect
    description.

  - Includes a Python script for parsing and analyzing execution
    contexts in a debug log.

Version 1.99.25.217 (Pre v2.0 Beta 2)
-------------------------------------

Changes since 1.99.24.128 (Pre v2.0 Beta 1)

KeyStore:

  - Master key lifetime can now be configured.  It can also be set
    to never expire.

Application:

  - Support for non-expiring identities.

  - Identity icon selection dialog now makes HTTP requests
    asynchronously.  The UI reports any errors that may occur during
    an HTTP fetch and provides a 'Stop' button to abort lengthy
    operations.

Kerberos v5:

  - Added UI controls for setting the 'Proxiable' flag for a new
    TGT.  The setting can be controlled as a global default and as a
    per-identity setting.

Bug fixes:

  - Handling of custom menus was fixed to avoid a situation where
    the wrong submenu may be displayed for an action.

  - Fixed several memory leaks.

  - The generated description for the default keystore had an
    unexpanded insertion sequence.

  - Saved originals of an identity icon image may have a different
    resolution than the source image and may not matched the saved
    crop rectangle.

User documentation:

  - Add missing how_to_choose_a_password.htm topic.

  - Add a section describing the format of the debug log file.

Source:

  - Updated copyright information.

  - Updated developer documentation.

  - Switch to khm_int32 for time intervals in khui_tracker controls
    to preserve ABI compatibility.

  - Introduce context menu notifications for credentials related
    context menus.  Plug-ins can now customize credentials context
    menus on a per-identity or per-credential basis.

  - Added LICENSE, README.xml and README.txt containing build
    instructions.

  - Moved to WiX 3.0 for building MSI based installers.

  - Refactored installers to generate .wixlibs for each plug-in.
