  Network Identity Manager
  ========================

  Version 1.99.25.217 (Pre v2.0 Beta 2)
  -------------------------------------

  Changes since 1.99.24.128 (Pre v2.0 Beta 1)

  KeyStore:

    - Master key lifetime can now be configured.  It can also be set
      to never expire.

  Application:

    - Support for non-expiring identities.

    - Identity icon selection dialog now makes HTTP requests
      asynchronously.  The UI reports any errors that may occur during
      an HTTP fetch and provides a 'Stop' button to abort lengthy
      operations.

  Kerberos v5:

    - Added UI controls for setting the 'Proxiable' flag for a new
      TGT.  The setting can be controlled as a global default and as a
      per-identity setting.

  Bug fixes:

    - Handling of custom menus was fixed to avoid a situation where
      the wrong submenu may be displayed for an action.

    - Fixed several memory leaks.

    - The generated description for the default keystore had an
      unexpanded insertion sequence.

    - Saved originals of an identity icon image may have a different
      resolution than the source image and may not matched the saved
      crop rectangle.

  User documentation:

    - Add missing how_to_choose_a_password.htm topic.

    - Add a section describing the format of the debug log file.

  Source:

    - Updated copyright information.

    - Updated developer documentation.

    - Switch to khm_int32 for time intervals in khui_tracker controls
      to preserve ABI compatibility.

    - Introduce context menu notifications for credentials related
      context menus.  Plug-ins can now customize credentials context
      menus on a per-identity or per-credential basis.

    - Added LICENSE, README.xml and README.txt containing build
      instructions.

    - Moved to WiX 3.0 for building MSI based installers.

    - Refactored installers to generate .wixlibs for each plug-in.
